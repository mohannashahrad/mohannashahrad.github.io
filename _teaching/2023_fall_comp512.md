Taught by Professor Bettina Kemme, Comp 512 (Distributed Systems course) is a graduate-level course that delves into the study of Models and Architectures in distributed systems. The course explores application-oriented communication paradigms such as remote method invocation and group communication. It also covers topics like naming services, synchronization (including mutual exclusion and concurrency control), fault-tolerance (including process and replication, agreement protocols), distributed file systems, and security.
