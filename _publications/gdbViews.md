title: "Towards View Management in Graph Databases"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/gdbViews
excerpt: 'This paper explores how views could be defined and used in graph database systems (GDBS) with a similar purpose to what can be found in relational systems. We performed our analysis using Neo4j and its query language Cypher which has many of the features typically found in graph query languages, aiming to pave the way for integrating view management into a wider range of GDBS.'
