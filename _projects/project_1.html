title: "CloudFormation templates for IoT data ingestion and visualization in the cloud"
excerpt: "<p style='vertical-align:middle'><img src='/images/pattern1.png' height='300px' width='300px'></p> <span style=''>In this project, I developed four different patterns to capture, ingest, and visualize IoT data landing from edge devices to AWS IoT Core. The CloudFormation templates provided in this project empower users to leverage various AWS services in order to achieve real-time and near-real-time visualization of their device data on intuitive dashboards without having to create and manage cloud reources themselves.</span>"
