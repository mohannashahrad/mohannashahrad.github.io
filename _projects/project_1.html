In this project, I developed and open-sourced four distinct patterns for capturing, 
ingesting, and visualizing IoT data from edge devices landing to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot-core/">AWS IoT Core</a>. 
By leveraging CloudFormation templates, users can effortlessly deploy these patterns 
to achieve real-time and near-real-time visualization of device data on intuitive 
dashboards without the need for extensive cloud resource management. 
Originally designed to enhance the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot-expresslink/">AWS IoT ExpressLink</a> customer experience, 
these patterns are adaptable to various edge devices and use cases. 
The templates encompass data ingestion via AWS IoT Core, real-time analytics with 
<a href=https://aws.amazon.com/iot-analytics>AWS IoT analytics</a>, 
<a href=https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-firehose>Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose</a>, 
<a href=https://aws.amazon.com/timestream>Amazon Timestream</a>, and 
<a href=https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service>Amazon OpenSearch Service</a> 
along with visualization options using <a href=https://aws.amazon.com/quicksight>Amazon QuickSight</a>, 
<a href=https://grafana.com>Grafana</a>, and other custom 
applications. The project's contributions are available in the AWS IoT ExpressLink 
<a href="https://github.com/aws/iot-expresslink">GitHub repository</a>.
