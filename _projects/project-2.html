This project implements a particle-based physics simulation inspired by Macklin et al.'s "Unified Particle Physics for Real-Time Application." 
It introduces a unified dynamics framework and particle solver specifically designed for modeling fluids (liquids and gases) and fluid-solid coupling. 
By utilizing particles connected by constraints, the solver allows for the unified treatment of contact and collisions, enabling efficient 
simulations. <a href="https://github.com/mohannashahrad/Unified-Particle-Solver-Fluid-Simulation">[Code]</a>.
