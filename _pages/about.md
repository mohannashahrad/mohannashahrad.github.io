About Me 
---------
I am a final-year undergraduate student at [McGill University](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/), pursuing a degree in Computer Science. My primary research interests lie in the field of computer systems. Starting in Fall 2023, I will be a visiting student at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/), where I am eagerly looking forward to a research internship during my exchange semester, supervised by Professor [Karthik Pattabiraman](https://blogs.ubc.ca/karthik/) at [Dependable Systems Lab](https://blogs.ubc.ca/dependablesystemslab/). 

During my time at McGill University, I worked as an undergraduate research assistant under Professor [Muthucumaru Maheswaran](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~maheswar/)'s supervision. I also conducted research as an NSERC USRA scholar under Professor [Bettina Kemme](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~kemme/)'s guidance while being a member of [Distributed Information Systems Lab](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~kemme/disl/index.html). During my academic journey, I have also done several industry internships, with my most recent experience being an SDE internship at [Amazon IoT](https://aws.amazon.com/iot/), [FreeRTOS](https://aws.amazon.com/freertos/) team.

I intend to pursue graduate school admission in the upcoming Fall of 2023. Motivated by my academic experiences at McGill University and a genuine passion for the field of computer systems, I am committed to pursuing advanced studies in this domain.
