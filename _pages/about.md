About Me 
---------
I am a first-year Ph.D. student at [Princeton University](https://www.cs.princeton.edu), supervised by Professor [Mae Milano](https://www.languagesforsyste.ms). I am broadly interested in distributed systems, focusing on performance and resilience. At the moment, I am studying resource management for cloud microservices.

I completed my undergraduate degree at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/), where I worked with Professor [Bettina Kemme](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~kemme/) as part of my [NSERC USRA](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/students-etudiants/ug-pc/usra-brpc_eng.asp) project. In my final year, I did an exchange semester as a visiting student at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/), where I was supervised by Professor Karthik Pattabiraman at the [Dependable Systems Lab](https://blogs.ubc.ca/dependablesystemslab/). There, I worked on developing a hybrid information flow control (IFC) framework for managing privacy in distributed IoT applications.
