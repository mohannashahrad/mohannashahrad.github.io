About Me 
---------
I am a first-year Ph.D. student at \href{https://www.cs.princeton.edu}{Princeton University}, supervised by Professor \href{https://www.languagesforsyste.ms}{Mae Milano}. I am broadly interested in distributed systems, focusing on performance and resilience. At the moment, I am studying resource management for cloud microservices.

I completed my undergraduate degree at \href{https://www.mcgill.ca/}{McGill University}, where I worked with Professor \href{https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~kemme/}{Bettina Kemme} as part of my \href{https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/students-etudiants/ug-pc/usra-brpc_eng.asp}{NSERC USRA} project. In my final year, I did an exchange semester as a visiting student at \href{https://www.cs.ubc.ca/}{the University of British Columbia}, where I was supervised by Professor \href{https://blogs.ubc.ca/karthik/}{Karthik Pattabiraman} at the \href{https://blogs.ubc.ca/dependablesystemslab/}{Dependable Systems Lab}. There, I worked on developing a hybrid information flow control (IFC) framework for managing privacy in distributed IoT applications.
