About Me 
---------
I am a final-year undergraduate student at [McGill University](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/), pursuing a degree in Computer Science. In Fall 2023, I will be joining the [University of British Columbia](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/) as a visiting student. My primary research interests lie in the field of computer systems.

During my time at McGill University, I had the valuable opportunity to work under the supervision of Professor [Muthucumaru Maheswaran](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~maheswar/). Additionally, I was honored to conduct research as an [NSERC USRA](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/students-etudiants/ug-pc/usra-brpc_eng.asp) scholar under the supervision of Professor [Bettina Kemme](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~kemme/) and be a member of [DISL](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~kemme/disl/index.html) (Distributed Information Systems Laboratory). I am looking forward to starting new research endeavors under the supervision of Professor [Karthik Pattabiraman](https://blogs.ubc.ca/karthik/) at the [DSL](https://blogs.ubc.ca/dependablesystemslab/) (Dependable Systems Lab) at UBC.
