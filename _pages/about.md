About Me 
---------
I am a final-year undergraduate student at [McGill University](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/), pursuing a degree in Computer Science. In Fall 2023, I will be joining the [University of British Columbia](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/) as a visiting student. My primary research interests lie in the field of computer systems.

During my time at McGill University, I worked as an undergraduate research assistant under Professor [Muthucumaru Maheswaran](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~maheswar/)'s supervision. I also conducted research as an NSERC USRA scholar under Professor [Bettina Kemme](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~kemme/)'s guidance while being a member of [DISL](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~kemme/disl/index.html) (Distributed Information Systems Laboratory). During my academic journey, I have also done several industry internships, with my most recent experience being an SDE internship at [Amazon IoT](https://aws.amazon.com/iot/), [FreeRTOS](https://aws.amazon.com/freertos/) team.


In Fall 2023, I'm excited to start a research internship during my exchange semester at UBC, supervised by Professor [Karthik Pattabiraman](https://blogs.ubc.ca/karthik/) at [DSL](https://blogs.ubc.ca/dependablesystemslab/) (Dependable Systems Lab).
