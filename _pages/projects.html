      <strong class="feature-title">CloudFormation Templates for IoT Data Ingestion and Visualization in the Cloud</strong>
      <p class="feature-description">Completed as part of my internship at AWS, this project involved developing and open-sourcing four different patterns for capturing, ingesting, and visualizing IoT data from edge devices into AWS IoT Core. These patterns, implemented using CloudFormation templates, enable effortless deployment of real-time and near-real-time data visualization on intuitive dashboards without extensive cloud resource management, benefiting AWS IoT ExpressLink customers and adaptable to various edge devices and use cases.</p>

      <strong class="feature-title">2D Unified Particle Solver for Fluid and Fluid-Solid Coupling Simulation</strong>
      <p class="feature-description">Completed as part of the COMP 559 course (Fundamentals of Computer Animation), this project involved the implementation of a particle-based physics simulation inspired by Macklin et al.'s "Unified Particle Physics for Real-Time Application". It introduces a unified dynamics framework and particle solver tailored for fluid (liquids and gases) and fluid-solid coupling modeling. By utilizing particles connected by constraints, the solver efficiently treats contact and collisions, enabling efficient simulations.</p>

      <strong class="feature-title">Design and Implementation of a Load-Balanced Elastic Cloud Infrastructure</strong>
      <p class="feature-description">Completed as part of the COMP 598 course (Cloud Computing), this project develops an elastic cloud management system with load balancing capabilities using HAProxy and Docker. The milestones include creating a basic cloud management system to handle interactive and non-interactive jobs, integrating HAProxy for optimized resource utilization, and making the cloud resource manager elastic to dynamically adjust resource allocation based on user demands.</p>

      <p class="feature-description">Completed as part of the Borealis AI mentorship program, Let's Solve, this project focuses on AI-driven environmental solutions to combat deforestation. Multiple ML models, such as Ensemble Trees, Arima, XGBoost, and LightGBM, were trained and assessed to predict the optimal number of trees required for planting worldwide. Additionally, an interactive Power Bi dashboard was created to demonstrate the predicted deforestation rates across the globe, showcasing the project's measurable outcomes.</p>

      <strong class="feature-title">Python-based AI Agent for Colosseum Survival Game"</strong>
      <p class="feature-description">Completed for the COMP 424 course (Artificial Intelligence), this project entailed the development of an AI agent in Python to compete in the Colosseum Survival game, a 2-player turn-based strategy game on an M <span>&#215;</span> M chessboard. By extending a minimalistic Python game engine, our objective was to implement an intelligent agent capable of utilizing Monte-Carlo Tree Search to identify threatening plays against opponents and leveraging worth and movement heuristics, along with augmenting the basic search with pathfinding algorithms to improve performance in enclosed spaces.</p>
