      <strong class="feature-title">CloudFormation Templates for IoT Data Ingestion and Visualization in the Cloud</strong>
      <p class="feature-description">Completed as part of my internship at AWS, this project involved developing and open-sourcing four different patterns for capturing, ingesting, and visualizing IoT data from edge devices into AWS IoT Core. These patterns, implemented using CloudFormation templates, enable effortless deployment of real-time and near-real-time data visualization on intuitive dashboards without extensive cloud resource management, benefiting AWS IoT ExpressLink customers and adaptable to various edge devices and use cases.</p>

      <strong class="feature-title">2D Unified Particle Solver for Fluid and Fluid-Solid Coupling Simulation</strong>
      <p class="feature-description">Completed as part of the COMP 559 course (Fundamentals of Computer Animation), this project involved the implementation of a particle-based physics simulation inspired by Macklin et al.'s <a href="https://mmacklin.com/uppfrta_preprint.pdf">"Unified Particle Physics for Real-Time Application"</a>. It introduces a unified dynamics framework and particle solver tailored for fluid (liquids and gases) and fluid-solid coupling modeling. By utilizing particles connected by constraints, the solver efficiently treats contact and collisions, enabling efficient simulations.</p>

      <strong class="feature-title">Design and Implementation of a Load-Balanced Elastic Cloud Infrastructure</strong>
      <p class="feature-description">Completed as part of the COMP 598 course (Cloud Computing), this project develops an elastic cloud management system with load balancing capabilities using HAProxy and Docker. The milestones include creating a basic cloud management system to handle interactive and non-interactive jobs, integrating HAProxy for optimized resource utilization, and making the cloud resource manager elastic to dynamically adjust resource allocation based on user demands.</p>
