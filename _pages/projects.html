      <strong class="feature-title">UnFaaSener: Latency and Cost Aware Offloading of Functions from Serverless Platforms</strong>
      <p class="feature-description">Collaborating with the CIRRUS lab at the University of British Columbia, I participated in the UnFaaSener project, a lightweight framework aimed at empowering serverless developers to optimize expenses through the utilization of non-serverless compute resources. My role primarily involved conducting performance comparisons of UnFaaSener with alternative implementations of the project's benchmarks on two popular serverless workflow platforms: AWS Step Functions and Google Workflows.</p>
