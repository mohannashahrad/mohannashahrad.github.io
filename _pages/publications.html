            <h3 class="publication-title">Towards View Management in Graph Databases</h3>
        </a>
        <p class="publication-venue">Appeared in <i>3rd Workshop on Search, Exploration, and Analysis in Heterogeneous Datastores: Graph Edition (SEA-Graph 2024)</i> co-located with <i>40th IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE 2024)</i></p>
        <p class="publication-authors">Authors: <strong>Mohanna Shahrad, You Ting Gu, Yunjia Zheng, Bettina Kemme</strong></p>
        <p class="publication-abstract">Views are widely used in relational databases to facilitate query writing, give individualized abstractions to different user groups, and improve query execution time with materialization techniques. This paper explores how views could be defined and used in graph database systems (GDBS) with a similar purpose to what can be found in relational systems. We perform our analysis using Neo4j and its query language Cypher, which has many features typically found in graph query languages, aiming to pave the way for integrating view management into a wider range of GDBS.</p>

        </a>
        <p class="publication-venue">Appeared in <i>2023 USENIX Annual Technical Conference (USENIX ATC 23)</i></p>
        <p class="publication-authors">Authors: <strong>Ghazal Sadeghian, Mohamed Elsakhawy, Mohanna Shahrad, Joe Hattori, Mohammad Shahrad</strong></p>
        <p class="publication-abstract">UnFaaSener is a lightweight framework that enables serverless users to reduce their bills by harvesting non-serverless compute resources such as their VMs, on-premise servers, or personal computers. It performs adaptive offloading of a developer's functions to their own alternative hosts by dynamically considering latency and cost implications of offloading as well as resource availability predictions on hosts against goals conveyed by the developer.</p>
